### my history

I started my IT career when I became a scholar of [PLDT Infoteach Outreach Program](https://sites.google.com/site/pldtinfoteachprogram/) way back 2011. I was held as the Computer Wizard of our batch, and became Quezon National High Shool's Representative to the PLDT MyDSL Broadband Quiz challenge. I won 4th place on the Regional Level and 3rd place on the National Level Quiz Bee.

After graduating high school, I took Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at Southern Luzon State University (S.Y. 2011 - 2016). In my 4th and 5th year in the university, I was elected as Public Relations Officer (for Integrated Computer Engineering Society) and Auditor (for Society of Computer Engineering Students). I also attended several student conference and trainings.
