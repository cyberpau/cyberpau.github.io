<h3>Operations Career with a Startup Telecommunication Company</h3>
<p>After experiencing the corporate world, I said to my self that I want to try to join a startup company. Luckily, I
    also got an offer from DITO Telecommunity, a startup telecommunication company in the Philippines.</p>
<p>DITO Telecommunity (formerly Mislatel) is a consortium between Filipino Entreprenuer Dennis Uy and China Telecom.</p>
<p>I was hired as a Full Stack Developer - Specialist; but because it is a startup company, I also wore the role of
    DevOps and Site Reliability Engineer - using Cloud and containers as a tool to automate and scale things.</p>
