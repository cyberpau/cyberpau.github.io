<h2>Meet Tomodachi, my virtual assistant</h2>
<p><b>Tomodachi</b> (<i>Friend in Japanese</i>) is an intelligent chatbot I developed to help head hunter and site visitors on their queries and concerns. It also helps filter out spammers, by removing email address in website content and put it in Tomodachi's conversation flow. As a developer, I value Security and Data Privacy.</p>
