<p>April 2019, I attended a training by </p>

<p>A short background of my first company, WeServ Systems International (also known as Fujitsu Philippines Global
    Delivery Center). In our Retail Services Department, we support the Point-Of-Sales applications of Fujitsu Americas
    Inc.</p>

<p>On my early years with Fujitsu, I learned to develop Java and .NET applications, together with MSSQL as the
    relational database. I had a good grasp in the Software Development Lifecycle. The management is also very
    supportive in our own personal endeavors, and we regularly conduct an innovation competition to showcase what We
    also used both Waterfall and Agile methology in our project management, I can proudly say that I had a good start in
    my career. </p>

<h3>Operations Career with a Startup Telecommunication Company</h3>
<p>After experiencing the corporate world, I said to my self that I want to try to join a startup company. Luckily, I
    also got an offer from DITO Telecommunity, a startup telecommunication company in the Philippines.</p>
<p>DITO Telecommunity (formerly Mislatel) is a consortium between Filipino Entreprenuer Dennis Uy and China Telecom.</p>
<p>I was hired as a Full Stack Developer - Specialist; but because it is a startup company, I also wore the role of
    DevOps and Site Reliability Engineer - using Cloud and containers as a tool to automate and scale things.</p>
