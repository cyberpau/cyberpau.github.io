<h3>Journey to Chatbots</h3>
<p>I love Chatbots, since I'm an introvert I usually prefer talking to robots than to humans (just kidding ðŸ˜œ!). Joking
    aside, Chatbots really gives value to any business. During my 1 year of exploring this field, I have developed
    several intelligent chatbots including Tri-C.E.R.A. bot (won Fujitsu RS Dev Team Best Innovation for Q1), Personal
    Assistant Chatbot (Kiwi) and an HR and Employee Chatbot for a Telecommunication Industry.</p>
<p>Currently, my chatbots can have the following features:
<ul>
    <li>Book a Meeting</li>
    <li>Subscribe to mailing list</li>
    <li>Ask Career and Personal Questions</li>
    <li>Display Graphs and Charts</li>
    <li>Login / Sign-up</li>
    <li>Upload Documents and Query texts from those Files</li>
    <li>Dynamically add new conversation tree</li>
    <li>Connect to 3rd party APIs</li>
    <li>Small Talks</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>I'm a Full Stack Developer</h3>
<p>I have a total of 5 years in Developing applications; 3 and half years for Point-of-Sales applications using VB.NET /
    SQL Server and CRM Systems using Java, XSLT, SQL Server. One year developing Chatbots, using Dialogflow or
    own-developed User Interface (using Vaadin, a Java Framework).</p>

<p>I also took part in Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment - both in enterprise and in personal projects.</p>
