<p>DITO Telecommunity (formerly Mislatel) is a consortium between Filipino Entreprenuer Dennis Uy and China Telecom.</p>
<p>I was hired as a Full Stack Developer - Specialist; but because it is a startup company, I also wore the role of DevOps and Site Reliability Engineer - using Cloud and containers as a tool to automate and scale things.</p>
