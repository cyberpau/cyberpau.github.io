<h2>Hello Guest! Meet my Assistant Chatbot</h2>
<h2>Meet Pewie, my Virtual Assistant</h2>
<p><b>Tomodachi</b> (<i>Friend in Japanese</i>) is an intelligent chatbot I developed to help head hunter and site
    visitors on their queries and concerns. It also helps filter out spammers, by removing email address in website
    content and put it in Tomodachi's conversation flow. As a developer, I value Security and Data Privacy.</p>
